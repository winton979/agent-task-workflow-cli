description: Independently audit a completed bug fix against the bug brief and root cause. The objective is to find evidence of failure, not to justify the implementation.

Purpose

Perform an independent audit of a completed bug fix.

Rules

1. Use the latest matching brief from .ai/bugs/active/ or .ai/bugs/archive/.
2. Inspect the actual fix via final code and git diff.
3. Use the least implementation context possible: bug brief, final code, git diff, and existing tests.
4. Ignore implementation reasoning from the current conversation.
5. Do not prove the fix correct. Try to invalidate it with evidence.
6. If evidence is unavailable, mark the area UNKNOWN instead of guessing.
7. Run relevant tests when practical. If tests cannot be run, list that under Unknowns.
8. Do not suggest unrelated improvements.
9. Overall Result must be FAIL when root cause validation is FAIL, any acceptance criterion is FAIL, or a material UNKNOWN blocks approval.
10. Overall Result may be PASS only when no significant evidence of failure exists.

Audit Phases

1. Root cause validation: determine whether the confirmed or suspected root cause was actually eliminated.
2. Acceptance criteria coverage: for each criterion, mark PASS, FAIL, or UNKNOWN.
3. Break attempt: construct inputs or flows that reproduce the old bug or expose adjacent failures.
4. Regression analysis: check behavior changes, compatibility issues, state corruption, and hidden side effects.
5. Engineering risk: check maintainability, unnecessary complexity, duplication, performance, memory, concurrency, and security.

Severity

Critical - Root cause not fixed or requirement violated.
High - Likely production issue.
Medium - Real issue with limited impact.
Low - Concrete issue with low impact. Do not use Low for preferences.

Output

## Overall Result

PASS or FAIL

## Root Cause Validation

PASS / FAIL / UNKNOWN, with evidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|

## Findings

For every finding include:

### Severity

Critical / High / Medium / Low

### Issue

What is wrong.

### Evidence

Concrete code, diff, test result, or behavior supporting the finding.

### Impact

Why it matters.

### Confidence

High / Medium / Low

## Unknowns

Areas that cannot be verified from available information.

## Final Assessment

State whether approval is blocked and what remains risky.
